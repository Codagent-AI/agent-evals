## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Demo presentation technical quality
The evaluation SHALL score the delivered demo presentation out of 24 using the following rubric. Deterministic browser evaluation SHALL inspect the built, running demo. LLM source review SHALL inspect the delivered source and supporting evidence. The LLM SHALL assess technical implementation and SHALL NOT assess visual taste, perceived motion quality, or responsive aesthetics, which belong to human review.

| Subcomponent | Points | Evaluator | Criteria |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Canonical content, routing, and technical structure | 5 | Deterministic browser | `demo-route-and-registration`, `demo-nine-step-content-and-order`, `demo-required-scene-content`, `demo-evolving-scene-structure`, `quality-captions-and-navigation` |
| Navigation, modes, boundaries, and controls | 5 | Deterministic browser | `demo-present-mode-behavior`, `demo-browse-mode-behavior`, `demo-mode-position-preservation`, `demo-supported-navigation`, `demo-navigation-boundaries-and-control-keys` |
| Runtime reliability and accessibility baseline | 4 | Deterministic browser | `demo-step-and-transition-reliability`, `demo-mode-interaction-reliability`, `demo-control-semantics`, `demo-focus-and-keyboard-accessibility` |
| Uses scene-kit APIs without bypassing or duplicating them | 4 | LLM source review | `demo-scene-kit-api-use` |

| Maintains clear boundaries and scope discipline | 3 | LLM source review | `demo-clear-code-boundaries`, `quality-active-chrome-and-attribution-local`, `demo-scope-discipline` |

The deterministic evaluator SHALL preserve the presentation's initial mode when opening it. Before traversing captions and canonical content, it SHALL explicitly enter browse mode. Before a mode-specific probe, it SHALL explicitly enter that probe's required present or browse mode. It SHALL NOT treat captions intentionally hidden in present mode as missing content. It SHALL change modes through a presentation-exposed mode control when one is discoverable, and SHALL fall back to a keyboard shortcut only when no such control exists.

The deterministic evaluator SHALL drive the browser through primitives every supported chrome-devtools-axi build provides, and SHALL NOT depend on adapter behavior that varies between builds, including the adapter's own wait helper and whether a page callback closes over the driving script's scope. Before asserting responsive presentation chrome, the deterministic evaluator SHALL establish and record a suite-owned viewport. It SHALL discover navigation through either stable presentation-owned hooks or equivalent semantic navigation regions, native interactive descendants, accessible names, and current-state attributes. It SHALL accept any ARIA-valid current-state value for the active step. The absence of one non-normative per-control selector SHALL NOT be treated as a product failure. When a conforming page exposes multiple indistinguishable controls and the evaluator cannot identify the intended target deterministically, it SHALL report the observation as unavailable with a harness diagnostic rather than fabricate a product failure. A page that reports no mode or no step index has not answered at all, so the evaluator SHALL raise a resumable harness failure rather than record a product deduction.

Deterministic criteria SHALL assert only mechanically provable behavior. They SHALL NOT require a design choice the candidate-facing fixture does not state. Specifically, the deterministic browse-mode criterion SHALL require browse mode to be reported, the active step's caption to be exposed, and every step to be reachable from a discovered navigation region; it SHALL NOT require the active step title in preference to the deck title, a visible table of contents, or simultaneously visible previous and next controls. The deterministic present-mode criterion SHALL require present mode to be reported and the active step's title to be exposed by any visible title element, and SHALL NOT require one element to carry it, nor judge that title's visual prominence. Whether browse and present chrome are composed well SHALL be judged by `mode-browse-reading-focused`, `mode-present-title-focused`, and human review.

The canonical-content checks SHALL verify the registered demo route, the nine required steps in their specified order, their normative titles, captions, and scene content, and their implementation as one evolving scene. Route registration SHALL be judged by whether the declared demo route is reachable and operable. Landing-page link discovery SHALL be recorded as an observation and SHALL NOT by itself produce a product deduction. Normative title and caption comparison SHALL normalize Unicode punctuation variants and whitespace before comparing.

The evolving-scene check SHALL derive a scene identity only from a candidate-declared scene identity. When no scene identity is declared, the evaluator SHALL record it as undeclared and SHALL judge the criterion on entity persistence alone, rather than comparing a substitute value with itself.

The navigation checks SHALL exercise present and browse modes, mode changes, supported navigation inputs, direct controls, and end boundaries. When a check activates a navigation control, it SHALL activate it the way a pointer does, focusing the control before firing, so that a presentation which suppresses deck keys while its own control holds focus is observable rather than hidden by the probe. A check that needs a control SHALL establish whichever mode exposes one rather than skip itself when the mode it started in has none. Establishing a precondition SHALL remain neutral, so one defect is not charged to every criterion that happens to position the demo. The reliability and accessibility checks SHALL exercise step transitions and mode interactions, monitor browser failures, and inspect control semantics, current-state exposure, focus behavior, and keyboard operability.

Every deterministic probe artifact SHALL retain a bounded observation of what the evaluator saw: the established viewport, mode, step index and count, active title and caption, chrome visibility, the discovered controls, and the selector or strategy that matched each navigation role. The retention bound SHALL cover a full traversal of every step in both modes, and a probe that exceeds it SHALL publish the number of observations it dropped rather than truncate silently. A deduction SHALL be adjudicable from the retained artifact without replaying the run.

Candidate text retained as evidence SHALL be normalized exactly once. The evaluator SHALL separate collapsing and truncating candidate text, which SHALL be idempotent, from escaping it for a rationale or report, which SHALL be applied once at the emitting edge. Retained artifacts SHALL NOT contain repeatedly escaped text. A probe that returns evidence which is not a list SHALL be recorded as a single citation rather than decomposed.

Browser-process and adapter diagnostics SHALL never become candidate failure evidence. The evaluator SHALL classify the adapter's channel, executable-path, and usage-help output as browser infrastructure, SHALL raise a resumable harness failure when a probe observes one, and SHALL NOT record it as a page console failure, an unregistered route, or any other product deduction.

The deterministic browser evaluator SHALL have real-browser regression coverage against the pinned reference presentation. The reference regression SHALL require caption and canonical-content criteria to pass and SHALL NOT rely only on mocked mode state.

Deterministic source facts supplied to an LLM source judge SHALL be treated as leads rather than authoritative verdicts. The judge SHALL inspect cited source and resolve contradictions. Equivalent semantic current-state attributes and stable presentation-owned active hooks SHALL satisfy the active-state contract without requiring one hard-coded hook spelling. Source review of code boundaries SHALL also identify public API inputs or shared constants that are declared but not used by the delivered behavior. A dead or misleading contract consumed by the delivered demo SHALL be scored under `demo-clear-code-boundaries` exactly once even when its declaration lives in shared scene-kit source, and SHALL NOT receive a duplicate deduction in another component.

#### Scenario: Deterministic demo behavior is scored
- **WHEN** the built demo is available to the evaluator
- **THEN** deterministic browser checks exercise every demo criterion assigned to them
- **AND** the scorer applies the listed point allocations to their pass/fail results

#### Scenario: Presentation opens in present mode

- **THEN** opening it for evaluation preserves present mode
- **AND** caption checks explicitly enter browse mode before traversing content

#### Scenario: Presentation opens in browse mode
- **WHEN** the presentation's initial mode is browse
- **THEN** opening it for evaluation preserves browse mode
- **AND** present-mode probes explicitly enter present mode before asserting presenter behavior

#### Scenario: Presenter captions are intentionally hidden
- **WHEN** present mode intentionally hides captions that are visible in browse mode
- **THEN** the evaluator does not fail canonical-content or caption criteria from the present-mode state

#### Scenario: Semantic navigation omits optional per-control hooks
- **WHEN** the presentation exposes progress and directional navigation as accessible native controls inside stable semantic regions
- **AND** those controls do not use the evaluator's optional per-control hook spelling
- **THEN** the deterministic evaluator discovers and exercises the controls by their observable semantics

#### Scenario: Responsive chrome is inspected reproducibly
- **WHEN** the evaluator asserts browse-mode table-of-contents, progress, or directional-control visibility
- **THEN** it first establishes the suite-owned viewport
- **AND** the evidence records the observed viewport dimensions

#### Scenario: Pinned reference browser regression runs
- **WHEN** the corrected deterministic browser evaluator is tested against the real pinned reference presentation
- **THEN** it operates the real presentation modes
- **AND** every reference caption and canonical-content criterion passes

#### Scenario: Demo source integration is scored
- **WHEN** the LLM judge reviews the demo implementation
- **THEN** it returns a pass/fail verdict, rationale, and cited source evidence for every demo criterion assigned to it
- **AND** the suite-owned scorer applies the listed weights

#### Scenario: Browse mode shows the deck title
- **WHEN** browse mode reports browse, exposes the active step's caption, and makes every step reachable from a discovered navigation region
- **AND** its header shows the deck title rather than the active step title
- **THEN** the deterministic browse-mode criterion passes
- **AND** the chrome composition judgment is left to `mode-browse-reading-focused` and human review

#### Scenario: A table of contents is responsive by design
- **WHEN** a presentation shows its table of contents only above a candidate-chosen minimum width
- **THEN** the deterministic browse-mode criterion does not deduct for its absence at the suite-owned viewport

#### Scenario: A boundary control is hidden rather than disabled
- **WHEN** a presentation hides its previous control on the first step instead of disabling it
- **THEN** the deterministic browse-mode criterion does not deduct for the hidden control

#### Scenario: Present mode exposes the active step title
- **WHEN** present mode reports present and exposes the active step's title
- **THEN** the deterministic present-mode criterion passes without judging that title's visual prominence

#### Scenario: The deck title and the step title use unexpected elements
- **WHEN** the element the evaluator ranks first as a title carries the deck title
- **AND** another visible title element carries the active step title
- **THEN** the deterministic present-mode criterion passes
- **AND** the probe observation records every visible title text it considered

#### Scenario: The demo route is reachable but unlinked
- **WHEN** the declared demo route is registered and reachable but the landing page does not link to it
- **THEN** `demo-route-and-registration` passes
- **AND** the probe observation records the discovered landing-page routes

#### Scenario: The route list carries an adapter diagnostic
- **WHEN** the browser adapter returns its own diagnostic output in place of a route list
- **THEN** the evaluator raises a resumable browser infrastructure failure
- **AND** it does not record an unregistered route or a page console failure against the candidate

#### Scenario: A normative title uses a different apostrophe
- **WHEN** a step title matches its normative text apart from a typographic apostrophe or collapsed whitespace
- **THEN** the canonical-outline comparison treats it as matching

#### Scenario: The active step is marked with aria-current="true"
- **WHEN** a navigation control marks the active step with `aria-current="true"`
- **THEN** `demo-control-semantics` accepts it as the current-step marker

#### Scenario: No scene identity is declared
- **WHEN** the presentation declares no scene identity
- **THEN** the probe observation records the scene identity as undeclared
- **AND** `demo-evolving-scene-structure` is judged on entity persistence across steps

#### Scenario: Mode changes use the presentation's own control
- **WHEN** the presentation exposes a mode control
- **THEN** the evaluator activates that control to change modes
- **AND** it uses the keyboard shortcut only when no mode control is discoverable

#### Scenario: A deduction is adjudicated from the retained artifact
- **WHEN** a reviewer audits a deterministic deduction after the run
- **THEN** the probe artifact supplies the established viewport, mode, step index and count, title, caption, chrome visibility, discovered controls, and the matched selector for each navigation role
- **AND** the reviewer does not need to replay the run to attribute the deduction

#### Scenario: A probe walks every step in both modes
- **WHEN** a probe observes each of the nine steps in present mode and again in browse mode
- **THEN** the probe artifact retains an observation for every state its verdict rests on
- **AND** the artifact reports how many observations were dropped, which is zero

#### Scenario: A control is activated the way a pointer activates it
- **WHEN** a check activates a navigation control to test whether deck keys still work
- **THEN** the control is focused before it is fired, as a pointer activation would
- **AND** a presentation that ignores deck keys while that control holds focus is observed rather than hidden

#### Scenario: Controls exist only in browse mode
- **WHEN** a presentation exposes its navigation controls in browse mode and none in present mode
- **THEN** the control-key check establishes browse mode and activates a control there
- **AND** a presentation that ignores deck keys after that activation is deducted rather than skipped

#### Scenario: The page reports no step index
- **WHEN** a state read returns no mode or no step index
- **THEN** the evaluator raises a resumable harness failure
- **AND** no criterion is deducted for the unreadable state

#### Scenario: The browser adapter differs from the one the suite was built against
- **WHEN** the installed chrome-devtools-axi build implements its wait helper or callback scoping differently
- **THEN** the evaluator still drives the browser, because it depends on neither

#### Scenario: Retained evidence is escaped once
- **WHEN** candidate text is collected as a failure and later cited as evidence
- **THEN** the retained artifact contains the text escaped at most once
